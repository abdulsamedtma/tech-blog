## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to our TA for taking the time to help explain how to use handlebars which is a popular templating engine for building dynamic web pages and rendering HTML templates in web applications. It works by allowing you to define HTML templates with placeholders (variables) and logic that can be dynamically filled in with data to produce the final HTML output.
